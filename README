Some helpers so that introspecting methods at runtime is *much* nicer.

How to use:
require 'xxx'
''.desc :strip
or
String.method_desc :strip


Note: if you want this to work *well* on 1.8.6 then you'll want to install ParseTree first
If you don't have the ri files for core [i.e. running "ri File" fails to return anything useful] then you're kind of stuck--you could request them from your package maintainer.

If you have not built them for your gems, you can easily:

gem rdoc --all --ri
