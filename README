Some helpers so that introspecting methods from irb is *much* nicer.

How to use:

'string'.desc :strip
or
String.method_desc :strip
or
String.method(:strip).desc

TODO a real example

How to install (sorry it's by hand currently_

gem install rogerdpack-method_descriptor


If you don't have the ri files for core [i.e. running "ri File" fails to return anything useful] then you're kind of stuck--you could request them from your package maintainer.

If you have not built them for your gems, you can easily:

gem rdoc --all --ri

Also, if your methods are built at run-time [i.e. meta programming] like

a.class_eval "
# a method
def go
 end
end
"

You could still access rdoc style descriptions by using the remembered_evals gem.
