Some helpers so that introspecting methods from irb is *much* nicer.

How to use:
require 'lib/desc_method'
''.desc :strip
or
String.method_desc :strip


How to install (sorry it's by hand currently_

gem install rdoc
gem install require_all
gem install rogerdpack-arguments
git clone 
then fire up irb and require 'lib/desc_method'



Note: if you want this to work *well* on 1.8.6 then you'll want to install ParseTree first
If you don't have the ri files for core [i.e. running "ri File" fails to return anything useful] then you're kind of stuck--you could request them from your package maintainer.

If you have not built them for your gems, you can easily:

gem rdoc --all --ri
